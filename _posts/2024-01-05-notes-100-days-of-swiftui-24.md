Completed [Day 24](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui/24) in [100 Days of SwiftUI](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui).

This session continues to practice [SwiftUI](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui) and add additional refinements to previous projects. Doing these simple additions are an excellent way to gauge understanding and address knowledge gaps.

Thinking through the problem space and applying the actual changes in code really helps to crystalize everything together. Definitely important to remember that concept again for myself.
