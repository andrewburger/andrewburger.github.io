Surprised and delighted with the new GitHub Free plan to allow unlimited private repositories for any developer in the world.  While this change could be one less reason for less open source to exist, it's an overall win for more code to exist.[^fn-open_source]

Microsoft appears to be a worthy steward of GitHub so far.  GitHub Enterprise continues to move forward and there's no sign of stopping.  Now every developer can have world-class source code hosting and workflows.

You can find out more about these changes on the blog [here](https://github.blog/2019-01-07-new-year-new-github).

[^fn-open_source]: Not all code can be open source, despite how great the benefit is for everyone.  Certain situations just don't fit that model.
