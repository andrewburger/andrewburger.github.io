Surprised and delighted with the new GitHub Free plan to allow unlimited private repositories for any developer in the world.  While this change could result less open source, it's an overall win for more developers (and code) to exist.[^fn-open_source]

Now every developer can have world-class source code hosting and workflows.

You can find out more about these changes on the blog [here](https://github.blog/2019-01-07-new-year-new-github).

[^fn-open_source]: Not all code can be open source, despite how great the benefit is for everyone.  Certain situations just don't fit that model.
