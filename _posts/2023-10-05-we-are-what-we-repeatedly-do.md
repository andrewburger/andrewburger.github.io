> We are what we repeatedly do. Excellence, then, is not an act, but a habit. – Aristotle

> ~ *Steve Jobs* 

It was once said that this was Steve's favorite quote.[^fn-followup]

As I think about Steve Jobs on the anniversary of his passing, I consider a person whose life influenced untold billions of people and for many generations to come as a pioneer of the personal computer and the cofounder of Apple. His impact upon modern society is unquestionable through his direct involvement in technology, innovation, and product development. Steve is well known for his passion, vision, storytelling, audacity, and meticulous attention to detail.

What inspires me about his example is that Steve achieved remarkable things and yet was very human. He was bold and made many painful mistakes. But his actions repeatedly demonstrated that he really believed in humanity's potential to determine our own destiny with a surprising amount of optimism. Steve had ideas about what products could exist and pursued that privilege and responsibility to make things worth making.

Exactly two years ago today, Tim Cook thoughtfully remarked:
> "Steve was so many things... He challenged us to see the world not for what it was, but for what it could be. And he helped so many people, myself included, see the same potential in ourselves... He spent every day imagining a future that no one else could see and working relentlessly to bring his vision to life... and I will cherish him always."

I endorse that sentiment and truly believe it.

Let us be bold. Follow your heart on the path to excellence. No matter who you are today, you can be that person who can show up, day after day, and make your own dent in the universe.
