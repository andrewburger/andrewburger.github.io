Finished [Day 33](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui/33) in [100 Days of SwiftUI](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui).

This section dives much further into [Animation](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/animation) with [SwiftUI](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui). We explored how the order of animation properties matter much like other SwiftUI modifiers, attaching [gestures](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/view/gesture(_:including:)) to a view with animations, showing and hiding views with [transitions](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/view/transition(_:)-2vjb8), and custom transitions using [ViewModifier](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/viewmodifier).

There is a lot to absorb but this aspect of SwiftUI is really cool! Adding type of visual functionality to a programming project is new to me.
