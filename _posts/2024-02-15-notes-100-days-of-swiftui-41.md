Completed [Day 41](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui/41) in [100 Days of SwiftUI](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui).

This section walks through the completion of the main project with [SwiftUI](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui) from the last few sessions. Along the way, we create our own [Xcode Preview](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/previews-in-xcode) with a custom body to support SwiftUI files that act as sub views and see new elements for the first time: [leading](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/horizontalalignment/leading), [Divider](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/divider), [Rectangle](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/rectangle), [strokeBorder](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/insettableshape/strokeborder(_:linewidth:antialiased:)-5qhjc), and [showsIndicators](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/scrollview/init(_:showsindicators:content:)).

This project feels like a fully fleshed with good structure to a modern project: local JSON with model data, Codable data models for data persistence, and multiple sub views with Navigation links in a multi-layer hierarchy. I got a similar feeling with our last project but it feels real now.

This project builds an app feels very close to something that could be in the App Store.
