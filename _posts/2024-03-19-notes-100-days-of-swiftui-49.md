Completed [Day 49](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui/49) in [100 Days of SwiftUI](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui).

First introduction to [concurrency](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/documentation/the-swift-programming-language/concurrency/) and [async/await](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/main/proposals/0296-async-await.md) in Swift. I tried it out with some basic structs and methods: [task](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/view/task(priority:_:)), [ASyncImage](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/asyncimage), [image](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/image), and [disabled](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/view/disabled(_:)).
