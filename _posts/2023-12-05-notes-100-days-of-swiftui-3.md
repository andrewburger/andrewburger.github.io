Spent the last two days with [Day 3](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui/3) in [100 Days of SwiftUI](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui).

There are interesting and flexible data types in Swift. In particular, [enum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enumerated_type) appears to be a great implementation in comparison to many other languages.
