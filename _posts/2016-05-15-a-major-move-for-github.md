Compliments to the Github staff on the new pricing structure for private repositories. This is *definitely* an interesting move - as I suspect that cost is one of the major objections in moving your 'hobby' code that you don't necessarily want to be public. It's just one more reason to do everything with your code over at GitHub, if you haven't already.[^fn-github_footnote]

As developers, we have a wealth of tools (it's almost an embarrassment really) that we could only dream of less than a decade ago. It's definitely time to enroll in a paid plan if you haven't already.

See the official announcement [here](https://github.com/blog/2164-introducing-unlimited-private-repositories).

[^fn-github_footnote]: Github has done an amazing job of democratizing and capturing the social aspect of programmers around the world. However, not all business models support 100% open source codebases. Driving down the price will only capitalize on the goodwill of the community and retaining their advantage.
