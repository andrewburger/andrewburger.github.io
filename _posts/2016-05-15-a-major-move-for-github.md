Compliments to the Github staff on the new pricing structure for private repositories. This is *definitely* an interesting move - as I suspect that cost is one of the major barriers for moving hobby activities that you don't want to be (public)[^fn-github_footnote].  As developers, we have a wealth of tools that we could only dream of years ago.

It's definitely time to enroll in a paid plan if you haven't already.  See the official announcement [here](https://github.com/blog/2164-introducing-unlimited-private-repositories).

[^fn-github_footnote]: Github has done an amazing job of democratizing and capturing the social aspect of programmers around the world. However, not all business models support 100% open source codebases.
