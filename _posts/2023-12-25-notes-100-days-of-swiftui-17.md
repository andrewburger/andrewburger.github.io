Completed [Day 17](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui/17) in [100 Days of SwiftUI](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui).

This section continues our journey with [SwiftUI](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui) to build the first app project. While the previous session focused on initial exposure to the Xcode development environment and the new [View](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/view) configuration and composition, this session followed a more practical approach.

The guided exercises introduced and added common elements into a working version of the app. We covered [State](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/state) property wrappers, [Section](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/section) container views within a [Form](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/form), [Picker](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/picker) controls, and using [NavigationStack](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/navigationstack) to present additional views in the app.

*Overall, I really like this approach. It is a great way to progressively learn and apply common SwiftUI components in the framework and routinely practice common development tasks within Xcode.*

Ready for more!
