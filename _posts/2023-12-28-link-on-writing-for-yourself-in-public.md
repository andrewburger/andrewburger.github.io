Wouter Groeneveld on the [Brain Baking website](https://brainbaking.com) writes about [his motivation to write in public](https://brainbaking.com/post/2023/11/on-writing-for-yourself-in-public/) and how that influences the content:

> Why write if nobody reads it? Why bother keeping a site up in the air when it is clear that the majority moved on? Who are we still writing for, then? The obvious answer is for yourself. Or is it? ...
>
> In essence, youâ€™re your own most devoted reader. If someone else happens to find your stuff and likes it: great! ...

> I think I never fully write for myself, but never fully write for others either. It takes a deliberate action to press the publish button...

> I still prefer writing in public, thereby hopefully positively influencing my little community the same way as my little community influences me.

There are lots of reasons to write. Hopefully one of them is about you, your interests, and growth. My latest series that documents my own journey with [100 Days of SwiftUI](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui) is a perfect example of writing where the act of writing invites clarity of thought, reflection on what I learned, and (hopefully) deeply integrate that knowledge for future recall years later.

*By writing in public, I introduce new possibilities where my actions could positively influence others, which is a helpful but secondary motivator, and sufficient self-commitment and scrunity to pursure the content with rigor and write behavior.*

I will continue to write more about my interests and see where that leads.
