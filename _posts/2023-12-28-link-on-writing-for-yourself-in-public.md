Wouter Groeneveld on the [Brain Baking website](https://brainbaking.com) describes [his motivation to write in public](https://brainbaking.com/post/2023/11/on-writing-for-yourself-in-public/):

> Why write if nobody reads it? Why bother keeping a site up in the air when it is clear that the majority moved on? Who are we still writing for, then? The obvious answer is for yourself...
>
> You can look into the more obscure topics... [but] why not write about the stuff that interests you? In essence, youâ€™re your own most devoted reader...
> 
> I never fully write for myself, but never fully write for others either. It takes a deliberate action to press the publish button...
>
> I still prefer writing in public, thereby hopefully positively influencing my little community the same way as my little community influences me.

There are lots of reasons to write. My hope is that at least one of them is related to you, your interests, and personal growth.

The latest series documenting my journey with [100 Days of SwiftUI](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui) where the act of writing forces clarity, reflection, and deeper learning, which has immediate benefits now. Sharing it with others also reinforces commitment to continue with rigor and ultimately produce better writing.

*By writing in public, I can also positively influence others, which is a second source of motivation.*

I continue to write to see where it leads.
