Wouter Groeneveld on the [Brain Baking website](https://brainbaking.com) writes about [his motivation to write in public](https://brainbaking.com/post/2023/11/on-writing-for-yourself-in-public/) and how that influences the content:

> Why write if nobody reads it? Why bother keeping a site up in the air when it is clear that the majority moved on? Who are we still writing for, then? The obvious answer is for yourself...
>
> You can look into the more obscure topics... [but] why not write about the stuff that interests you? In essence, youâ€™re your own most devoted reader...
> 
> I never fully write for myself, but never fully write for others either. It takes a deliberate action to press the publish button...
>
> I still prefer writing in public, thereby hopefully positively influencing my little community the same way as my little community influences me.

There are lots of reasons to write. My hope is that at least one of them is related to you, your interests, and personal growth. My latest series documenting my  journey with [100 Days of SwiftUI](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui) is a perfect example where creating written content encourages clarity, reflection, and (hopefully) better integration on knowledge with immediate benefits now and potentially years later.

*By writing in public, I introduce new possibilities where my actions could positively influence others, which is a helpful but secondary motivator, and provide reinforcing factors that increases my own commitment to continue this journey with rigor and ultimately produce better writing.*

I will continue to write and see where it leads.
