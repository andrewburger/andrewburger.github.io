Completed [Day 48](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui/48) in [100 Days of SwiftUI](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui).

I like the videos on this day. A fun format to learn something new and suggest better ways of working and learning.

It was worth the time to watch and learn outside of the normal (e.g. "here's something new we are doing in Xcode, try to learn that, and incorpate the new knowledge with consistent efforts to practice over time.").
