Finished [Day 8](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui/8) in [100 Days of SwiftUI](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui).

Catchup day focused on [default arguments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Default_argument) and [error handling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exception_handling). I really haven't used error handling in this way. In the past, I would rather think of possible problems and solve them appropriate with normal functions instead. I will keep an open mind about this approach.

Most time during this section was spent on the checkpoint challenge, which required more syntax lookup to address the scenario with Swift error handling.
