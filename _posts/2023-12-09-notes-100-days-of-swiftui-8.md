Finished [Day 8](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui/8) in [100 Days of SwiftUI](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui).

Catchup day focused on [default arguments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Default_argument) and [error handling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exception_handling). I really have not used error handling in this way and will keep an open mind. My approach in the past was to think exhaustively about possible problems but solve them using normal functions instead.

I spent most of the time on the checkpoint challenge to address the scenario with Swift error handling.
