Finished [Day 15](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui/15) in [100 Days of SwiftUI](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui).

This section reviews all the [Swift language](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/documentation/the-swift-programming-language) concepts and content from prior sessions. It is a consolidation day.

*Spending time to learn, build, practice, reflect, and share each day is working.*

I really appreciate all the different modes to learn (daily video, session transcript, optional content) and practice new concepts (follow video exercises, modify code snippets in Xcode, complete code checkpoint challenges, answer review questions). Very happy with progress so far.

Taking extra time to write after each section is beyond the expectation of this learning experience but it really helps. After all, the real clarity and perspective comes through the effort to [put your ideas into words](https://paulgraham.com/words.html).

Looking forward to the next section!
