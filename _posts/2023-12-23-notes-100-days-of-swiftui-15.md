Finished [Day 15](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui/15) in [100 Days of SwiftUI](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui).

This section reviews all the [Swift language](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/documentation/the-swift-programming-language) concepts and content from prior sessions and happy with progress so far. I really appreciate all the different modes to learn (watching video, reading through the transcript, optional content) and practice new concepts (following exercises the video, spending time in Xcode, code checkpoint challenges, review questions).

Taking the time to write and share what I learned is really helping to more deeply integrate everything into working knowledge. Or in other words, working to build [knowledge by acquaintance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge_by_acquaintance) and knowledge by description.

The daily dive with practical effort and continual effort is working. Looking forward to the next section as I dive into SwiftUI.
