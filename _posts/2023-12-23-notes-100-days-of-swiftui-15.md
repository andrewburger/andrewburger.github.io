Finished [Day 15](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui/15) in [100 Days of SwiftUI](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui).

This section reviews all the [Swift language](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/documentation/the-swift-programming-language) concepts and content from prior sessions. It is a consolidation day.

I really appreciate all the different modes to learn (watching video, reading through the transcript, optional content) and practice new concepts (following exercises the video, spending time in Xcode, code checkpoint challenges, review questions). Very happy with progress so far.

Taking time to write down something after each section is really helping to translate everything into working knowledge. Or in other words, I am working to build both [knowledge by acquaintance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge_by_acquaintance) and knowledge by description.

Spending time to learn, build, and practice each day is working. Looking forward to the next section.
