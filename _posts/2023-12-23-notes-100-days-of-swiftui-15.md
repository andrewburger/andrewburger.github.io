Finished [Day 15](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui/15) in [100 Days of SwiftUI](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui).

This section reviews all the [Swift language](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/documentation/the-swift-programming-language) concepts and content from prior sessions. It is a consolidation day.

*Spending time to learn, build, and practice each day is working.*

I really appreciate all the different modes to learn (daily video, session transcript, optional content) and practice new concepts (follow video exercises, modify code snippets in Xcode, complete code checkpoint challenges, answer review questions). Very happy with progress so far.

Taking extra time to reflect and write after each section is really helping. I am intentionally building new knowledge through [knowledge by acquaintance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge_by_acquaintance) and *knowledge by description*.

Looking forward to the next section!
