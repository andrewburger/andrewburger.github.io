All done with [Day 7](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui/7) in [100 Days of SwiftUI](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui).

Learned more about [tuples](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuple) and why you might use them, which was great. There was a partcularly section about parameter naming. In previous encounters with Objective-C and earlier versions of Swift, I found the various styles of [named parameters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Named_parameter) and functions with equivalent names but different parameters to be confusing. There are many naming options for functional arguments and parameters.

Paul Hudson is doing a really good job of teaching necessary components on a specific learning path that embodies the principle of [progressive disclosure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_disclosure). When learning something new, you are likely to not know what you need or what is relevant. All of the material and related exercises are specific and well-considered. It feels like a natural path that [activates and builds upon prior knowledge](https://poorvucenter.yale.edu/StudentsPriorKnowledge).
