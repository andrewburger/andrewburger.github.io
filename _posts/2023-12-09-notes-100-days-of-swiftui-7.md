All done with [Day 7](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui/7) in [100 Days of SwiftUI](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui).

Finally got a little context around [tuples](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuple) and why you might use them, which was helpful. And a lot of helpful orientation around parameter naming. In previous encounters with Objective-C and earlier versions of Swift, I was confused around various styles of [named parameters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Named_parameter) and functions with equivalent names but different parameters. There are a lot of options to name functional arguments and parameters.

Paul Hudson is doing a really good job of teaching necessary components on a specific learning path that embodies the principle of [progressive disclosure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_disclosure). When there is so much to learn in a new field, you will likely not know what you need or what is relevant at the start. All of the material and related exercises are specific, well-considered, and build upon prior knowledge.
