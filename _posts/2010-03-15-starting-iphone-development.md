I have a confession to make. I love my iPhone. Despite what limitations it may have, it is a truly revolutionary device that has taken the world by storm and made possible a wide assortment of technological innovation. It has also become a one-of-kind platform to develop amazing applications and distribute them directly to any iPhone owner in the world. The motto "There's an app for that" by Apple truly can be conceived and realized with enough ingenuity.

I have taken it upon myself to begin to learn iPhone development and explore what the platform has to offer and see what I can do with it. In the last few days, I have registered with Apple to download the iPhone SDK and make a few of them myself. It has very simple to a few small programs and test them out with the included iPhone Simulator program. It has been very promising so far, even for someone with no Mac or Objective C programming background.
