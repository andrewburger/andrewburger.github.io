Completed [Day 27](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui/27) in [100 Days of SwiftUI](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui).

This session continues to practice the same elements from yesterday with some extra refinements and clarifications. For example, we used [MLModelConfiguration](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/coreml/mlmodelconfiguration) to generate the [prediction value](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/createmlcomponents/annotatedprediction/prediction) from the model, the [static keyword](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/documentation/the-swift-programming-language/properties/#Type-Property-Syntax) to assign the result to a computed variable, and [Markdown syntax to perform automatic grammar agreement](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/text/init(_:)-1a4oh) on localized strings.

For that last one, we changed word pluralization in text based upon related quantities. Pretty neat!
