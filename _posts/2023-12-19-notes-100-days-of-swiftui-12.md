Finished [Day 12](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui/12) in [100 Days of SwiftUI](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui).

This section covers [classes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Class_%28computer_programming%29) in detail, particularly around [inheritance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inheritance_(object-oriented_programming)) and [instantiation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instance_(computer_science)). Despite being a little rusty, it was a good refresher on data reference types and other patterns in [object-oriented programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming).

As a side note, I really come to appreciate the Xcode Playgrounds experience to reinforce learning and build prototypes.
