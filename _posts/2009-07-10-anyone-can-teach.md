No matter what path you walk in life, you have unique knowledge that only you can share.  You are the only one who has lived in the exact way that you have.  You have accumulated certain experiences, talents, interests, and knowledge and combined them together in such a fashion that no one else has.  That knowledge can truly unlock your life and give purpose.  We all have that innate desire to benefit others with our knowledge and to be needed, whether we admit it to ourselves or not.  You can only teach what you know, but I will tell you how to do it. Think and use **R.E.A.S.O.N.**


### RECOGNIZE Your Fear

Okay, so you don't have a PhD. If you knew everything, then there would be no problem right?  Wrong.  One of the most common assumptions on our own ability to teach requires that we know everything on a particular topic, and we need to study it for years, in order to teach it.  The root of the problem is fear.  You fear not having the answers that inevitably come up while teaching.  You fear that they will not find you interesting.  You fear ...   Yes, there may be many fears.  It can paralyze you.  Much of it can be overwhelming at the beginning, but when you begin with courage and do it regardless, you'll remember the reason why you are doing this, and be able to continue.

**Bottom line:** Fear is usually based upon the unknown, and over-the-top expectations. The rest of this section will help you to overcome this.


### EXPECT Mistakes

We are imperfect as human beings, and we will continue to do so.  Why should teaching be any different?  In fact, it is that personal, human touch that can make an experience life-changing.  Mistakes will happen - do not dwell on them.  They can be opportunities to help recognize patterns that you need to change, or even enrich your teaching experience. We sometimes try to force those "magic" moments shown in movies and theatre: they are filled with grand speeches and dramatic moments that cause us to gaze off into the lofty distance.  Great experiences are quite often based upon what appears to be ordinary and unremarkable at the time.  Think back to your own childhood for a moment.  What special moments do you remember when you were growing up?

**Bottom line:** Be flexible. Your intended plan of action will rarely lead to the expected outcome.  Don't try to "force" something through if it is not going to work.  That will make your job a lot harder.


### ACT On Your Instincts

Opportunities will not come always when we are ready or looking.  Many times the best lessons come when we can adapt our message to a situation.  In the course of teaching, you may feel the need to direct your attention to a slightly different topic, or perhaps to focus your discussion to address the needs of a particular student.  Look at who you are trying to teach and think about what you are doing.  You can sometimes see what is needed for the students, rather than stick to your "script" like a rigid robot. And while we mention this rigid "script", don't bother copying someone else's program and stick to it line by line.  Make it yours and adapt in a way that you can teach it effectively with your own style.

**Bottom line:** You must adapt your message to the individual, be receptive to opportunities, and play to your strengths.


### SHARE What You Know

Passion, compassion, and empathy are the virtues of any great teacher.  Excitement is contagious, and even provide laughs and entertainment!  Your passion on the subject will expand your student's mind and make them more receptive to what you are trying to teach.  They will want to understand as you do.  If you genuinely care about your students and their needs, you will get to know them.  Don't be superficial; it will only hinder you more.  They will not just be another face or number, but someone you can relate to.  This will be instrumental in teaching to the person in the right way, so that it will have meaning to them.  These are the seeds of any life-changing experience, and they will confide in you as a mentor and guide.  This can be one of the most satisfying experiences that one can experience - it will be special for both you and your student.

**Bottom line:** Passion and honesty are key. It will inspire and grant you respect, and make your message have a great positive impact to the individual.


### ORGANIZE Yourself

Be prepared. There are lots of little things that we can do to be ready when chances come.  You should respect your students time and be prompt.  Take care of your body and keep it in good shape so that your mind is sharp and your physical body will hinder you with an already difficult task.  Make sure you have a plan on how to teach beforehand, and take the time to review both the plan, and the material several days in advance before you teach.  It is surprising how many times it is left to the last minute, and it can make a great lesson into a moderate one, or even a negative experience.  Even outside of the classroom or formal training environment, simply "being ready" can present opportunities for small moments that can drastic alter someone's thoughts, actions, and beliefs in ways that are mind-boggling.

**Bottom line:** Being prepared will maximize your teaching capability.  Seriously neglecting this area can severely dampen your ability to communicate your message effectively, if you even can at all.  Do your best to be ever ready.


### NEVER Give Up!

Even if you follow all of the above, realize that it may not be enough.  It will not be the end of the world. Keep doing it. Persevere until the end.  You will be surprised that everything you think people see and pick up are not noticed.  Many times, they cannot see how nervous you are, that you didn't follow "The Plan", or that you don't know much about what you are talking about.  Most times, it will only be obvious to you.  It is easier to give up in the beginning when it is hard than near the end when we can see the finish line.  Make the effort to begin, and let yourself go until the end.

**Bottom line:** Stay the course. Practice makes more perfect.


### Conclusion

Teaching, in a large part, has a lot to do with the type of person you are, in addition to the knowledge you possess.  Many people understand readily that your knowledge on a subject will enhancing your ability to teach the material, but your ability to teach it is a different skill. Your obstacles will be fear, inflexibility, inattentiveness, apathy, disorganization, and a defeatist attitude.  You can teach with courage, flexibility, style, passion, organization, and can-do attitude.
