Wrapped up [Day 19](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui/19) in [100 Days of SwiftUI](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui).

The objective for this section is to create a new app without direct guidance using what we learned so far with [SwiftUI](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui). I completed the exercise and feel good about the result.

 [Debugging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debugging) using the App Preview pane is easy and natural in an Xcode Playground file, alongside simple [print statements](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debug_code#Print_debugging). Learning to [diagnose and resolve bugs in a running app](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/diagnosing-and-resolving-bugs-in-your-running-app) is more complicated, especially because SwiftUI is a [declarative framework](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/model-data).
 
During this round of development, displaying extra debugging values inside the current View during the investigation was the easiest approach. I plan to learn more about how to [debug an App Playground](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift-playgrounds/console-print-debugging), [set breakpoints](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/setting-breakpoints-to-pause-your-running-app), and [step through code](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/stepping-through-code-and-inspecting-variables-to-isolate-bugs) with Xcode.
