Did not complete [Day 34](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui/34) in [100 Days of SwiftUI](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui) yet.

I ran into unexpected issues while looking at these exercises to confirm understanding over the last few days. It was more difficult than expected. More importantly, I want to make sure to not become stuck.

I will continue learning, revisit occassionally, and update the notes once complete.
