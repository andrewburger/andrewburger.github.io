Finished [Day 14](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui/14) in [100 Days of SwiftUI](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui).

This section covers [optionals](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/optional) to handle `nil`, which is a [nullable type](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nullable_type). This option type for values that might be missing or otherwise undefind. A few scenarios that come to mind would be processing user input or [error handling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exception_handling).

As a type-safe language, optionals seem to one of the primary mechanisms to catch and fix errors early in the development process, which should result in more robust and safe code.
