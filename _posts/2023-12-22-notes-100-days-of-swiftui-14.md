Finished [Day 14](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui/14) in [100 Days of SwiftUI](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui).

This section covers [optionals](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/optional) to handle `nil`, a [nullable type](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nullable_type). This option type is for values that might be missing or otherwise undefined, which is important for proper [error handling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exception_handling) in code. I also learned how you can combine [optional chaining](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/documentation/the-swift-programming-language/optionalchaining/) with `??`, the  [nil-coalescing operator](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/optional#Using-the-Nil-Coalescing-Operator), to construct precise and succinct logic statements. I like it!

As a type-safe language, optionals seem to be an important mechanism to catch and fix errors early in the development process, which should result in more robust and safe code.
