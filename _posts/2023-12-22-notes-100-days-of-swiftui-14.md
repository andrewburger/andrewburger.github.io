Finished [Day 14](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui/14) in [100 Days of SwiftUI](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui).

This section covers [optionals](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/optional), which is the Swift mechanism for handling `nil` or [nullable types](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nullable_type). This option type handles values which might be missing otherwise undefind such as error handling or processing user input.

As a type-safe language, optionals seems to be a good way catch and fix errors early in the development process, which hopefully results in more robust and safe code.
