Quickly finished [Day 4](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui/4) in [100 Days of SwiftUI](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui).

Simple and short look at [type inference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_inference) and type annotation. Comes with a code challenge to confirm understanding, just like Day 2. Conceptually, no problem working through what to do but still needed to look up syntax for the more complex data types.

Like anything else, I imagine all this will become more natural with practice.
