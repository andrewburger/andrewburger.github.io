Did not complete [Day 47](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui/47) in [100 Days of SwiftUI](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui) yet.

The app in the consolidation project is almost complete. I was hoping to incorporate required functionality in a particular way but it did not work out yet. I learned a lot in the process.

Once again, I find myself more behind than expected and will recommit to course progression. As much as I am learning with some of these deeper sessions, it is also important to keep learning while moving into other section content.

I am recommitting to daily immersion to balance new ideas and better workflows with deeper independent learning and individual problem solving.
