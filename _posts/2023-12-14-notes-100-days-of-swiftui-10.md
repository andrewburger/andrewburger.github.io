Completed [Day 10](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui/10) in [100 Days of SwiftUI](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui).

This sections covers [structs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Struct_(C_programming_language)). It's not quite the same as a C struct but definitely has rich value types similar to a tuple. It seems like [a reasonable default when trying to decide between structs and classes](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/choosing-between-structures-and-classes#Choose-Structures-by-Default).

While I have seen a [getter and settet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutator_method) with Objective-C before, I really liked learning about [willSet and didSet observers](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/documentation/the-swift-programming-language/properties/) to actively attach code when interacting with properties.
