Starting a new series while going through [100 Days of SwiftUI](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui). Writing about that experience will share and more deeply integrate the material into working knowledge.

First, some initial impressions:
* Paul Hudson is precise, thoughtful, and pragmatic on what to learn and why.
* Prototyping new code and concepts using Swift Playgrounds within Xcode is very nice.
* I do like the thoughtful care taken to present new concepts and incorporate new knowledge through small and digestable portions. Adding optional reference material and review exercises to verify understanding throughout is effective and excellent reinforcement. 

Since Swift is not my first programming language, the real exercise here is to practice patience and diligence. I am enjoying the relaxed pace of progress and appreciate a start with well-explained fundamentals. 

The material and exercises will get eventually harder. Good habits and repetition  will help in the long run.

Off to a great start so far!
