Add a new series of notes for myself and others as I go through [100 Days of SwiftUI](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui). It is a good opportunity to share that experience and more deeply integrate the material into working knowledge.

First, some initial impressions:
* Paul Hudson is very precise, thoughtful, and pragmatic on what to learn and why.
* Prototyping new code and concepts using Swift Playgrounds within Xcode is very nice.
* I do like the optional reference material, the review exercises to self-verify understanding, and the thoughtful care taken to present the new lessons and incorporate new knowledge into small and digestable portions.

Since Swift is not my first programming language, I anticipate that the first portion will happen quickly and efficiently. I enjoy the relaxed pace of prgoress and appreciate a starting with well-explained fundamentals. 

I imagine that the material and exercises will get harder and that repetition will help a lot.

Off to a great start so far!
