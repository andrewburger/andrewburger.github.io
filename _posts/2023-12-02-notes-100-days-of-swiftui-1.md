Starting a new series while going through [100 Days of SwiftUI](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui). Writing about that experience will share and more deeply integrate the material into working knowledge.

First, let's start with initial impressions:
* Paul Hudson is precise, thoughtful, and pragmatic on what to learn and why.
* Prototyping new code and concepts in Xcode Playgrounds is very nice.
* I like the thoughtful care to present new concepts and incorporate new knowledge through small and digestible portions.
* Adding optional reference material and review exercises is effective and excellent reinforcement. 

Since Swift is not [my first programming language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BASIC), the real exercise is to practice patience and diligence. I am enjoying the relaxed pace of progress and appreciate a start with well-explained fundamentals.

The material and exercises will get harder. Good habits and repetition will eventually make a difference.

Off to a great start so far!
