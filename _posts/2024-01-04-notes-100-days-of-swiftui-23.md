Finished [Day 23](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui/23) in [100 Days of SwiftUI](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui).

This round is a deeper technical exploration of [SwiftUI](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui) with topics such as: ordering view [style modifiers](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/view-style-modifiers), how [opaque return types](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/documentation/the-swift-programming-language/opaquetypes/#Returning-an-Opaque-Type) make SwiftUI flexible and powerful, understanding the [View protocol](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/view) and the [ViewBuilder attribute](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/viewbuilder), combining the ternary conditional [operator type](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/operator-declarations) with modifiers, using [environment value modifiers](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/environment-values) and [custom modifiers](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/viewmodifier), and building [custom views](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/declaring-a-custom-view).

A lot to learn in one section but good exposure. Researching related documentation on my own has also been worthwhile.
