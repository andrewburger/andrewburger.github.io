Completed [Day 38](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui/38) in [100 Days of SwiftUI](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui).

This day feels mostly like a review with some extra challenges to confirm understanding. No new concepts but more like extra practice with [SwiftUI](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui).

Even while doing research on code-related topics, I can tell that my understanding is more complete prior to the start of this learning series. I have a much better grasp of how the code works even if I have never seen it before.
