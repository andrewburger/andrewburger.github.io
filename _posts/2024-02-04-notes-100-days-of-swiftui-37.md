Completed [Day 37](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui/37) in [100 Days of SwiftUI](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui).

This section revisits the data concepts from yesterday and added a few common ways to use these [SwiftUI](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui) elements. We defined a second [View](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/view) in a separate source file and called it from the main `ContentView` in the app. We called [JSONDecoder](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/jsondecoder) to [decode](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/jsondecoder/2895189-decode) previously saved data from disk. Finally, we designed a custom data model conforming to the [Codable](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/codable) and [Identifiable](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/identifiable) protocols that could create, store, and retrieve unique and persistent data store specified in a shared custom class.

It was enlightening to incrementally build a working application that showcases all these components working together.
