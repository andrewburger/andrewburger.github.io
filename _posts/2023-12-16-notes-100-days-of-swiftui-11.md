Completed [Day 11](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui/11) in [100 Days of SwiftUI](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui).

This section covers [access control](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/documentation/the-swift-programming-language/accesscontrol) for [structs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Struct_(C_programming_language)) with  private and static properties. This looks like the Swift language mechanism for [encapsulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encapsulation_(computer_programming)).

General rule of thumb is to be thoughtful about keeping data private for better encapsulation and to prevent unintentional errors.
