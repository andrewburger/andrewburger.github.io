Completed [Day 29](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui/29) in [100 Days of SwiftUI](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui).

This section continues our journey with [SwiftUI](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui) to build more common elements into apps such as: how to present data with static and dynamic data using [List](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/list), load files and other objects within the app bundle directory using [Bundle](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/bundle), and use the spell checker on words with [UITextChecker](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uitextchecker).

`UITextChecker` is an Objective-C class originally built for UIKit. This is my first experience in working UIKit-based classes through a Swift API. Fortunately, the class is available through SwiftUI without importing UIKit.
