Did not complete [Day 46](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui/46) in [100 Days of SwiftUI](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui) yet.

Most of it is complete. The first two challenges are done. I would eventually like to come back to the last one as time permits.

I will continue learning, revisit, and update notes once complete. Failing to add more time before moving beyond the final challenge again is not ideal. 

On a related note, there was a much longer break before resuming sessions than anticipated. The idea to "share progress" throughout the course is good encouragement for yourself.

I am hoping to keep practicing with new knowledge so that it stays fresh in my mind!
