Did not complete [Day 46](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui/46) in [100 Days of SwiftUI](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui) yet.

The first two challenges are complete. I plan to finish the last one and update the notes as time permits.

I took a longer break before resuming sessions than anticipated. Paulâ€™s suggestion to share progress throughout the course is helpful to increase your own commitment.

I want to keep practicing and learning!
