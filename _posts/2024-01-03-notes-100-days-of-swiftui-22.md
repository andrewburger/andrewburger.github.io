Finished [Day 22](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui/22) in [100 Days of SwiftUI](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui).

This section is unguided practice with [SwiftUI](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui) that adds to the project from yesterday. Three coding challenges and review questions.

Even with other distractions during the last few days, I can tell that I am much better and more comfortable with navigating Xcdoe, reading the code, investigation through debugging, making incremental changes, and navigating Xcode.

That is a win that I want to continue in 2024.
