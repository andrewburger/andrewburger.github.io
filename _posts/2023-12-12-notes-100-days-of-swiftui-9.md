Spent the last few days on [Day 9](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui/8) in [100 Days of SwiftUI](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui).

Focused heavily on learning about [closures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Default_argument) and their importance in Swift and SwiftUI. There was also a good section on passing functions as arguments to another function. Really pleased to see that Swift has excellent support for [First-class functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-class_function#Language_support)). .

The checkpoint challenge was a fun exercise to explore and confirm understanding on chaining multiple functions.
