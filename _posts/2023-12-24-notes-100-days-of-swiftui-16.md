Completed [Day 16](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui/16) in [100 Days of SwiftUI](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui).

This section starts our journey with [SwiftUI](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui), a modern Apple development framework to design and build graphical user interfaces. The framework is evolving rapidly compared to what already exists, so I will need to watch for [notable SwiftUI updates](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/Updates/SwiftUI).

Learning SwiftUI and modern user interface design with Xcode is not completely new but still very unfamiliar. Thankfully, today seemed to be a gentle introduction. I appreciated re-learning [Xcode basics](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode) such as: [configuring Xcode project windows](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/configuring-the-xcode-project-window), [building and running an app](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/building-and-running-an-app), [creating the app interface with SwiftUI along with Xcode Preview](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/creating-your-app-s-interface-with-swiftui), and [running the app using the Simulator](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/running-your-app-in-simulator-or-on-a-device) to verify app functionality and the user experience.

Understanding the new mental model and associated programming syntax to achieve the desired outcome is much harder now because of that unfamiliarity. I can no longer rely solely on previous (more traditional) programming experiences with other text-based code editors. One important learning goal for future success will be to fully embrace Xcode as an [integrated development environment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment) for app development.

Dedicated and repeated practice, along with Xcode autocompletion and Apple documentation, will be more important for increased familiarity and confidence.
