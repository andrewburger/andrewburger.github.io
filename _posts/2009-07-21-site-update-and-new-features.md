After a longer break than anticipated, the site is now back into operation.  There were a few security concerns with the host, which have been addressed, but have caused certain functionality to be unavailable for a time.  They have been extremely sympathetic and transparent in the entire process, and things are now better as a result.

Since the incident, I have added more options to the site to easily email and share posts with others that you may find these articles interesting.  You can email them directly or use the popular Twitter service to quickly send a link to your followers.  You can also use the "ShareThis" option to select which method is most convenient for you - there are many choices there.

I will be adding a few more needed pages this week, such as a Contact page, etc.  Then, I will get straight to the Articles.  I do thank you for your patience!
