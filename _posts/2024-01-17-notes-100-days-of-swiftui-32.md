Completed [Day 32](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui/30) in [100 Days of SwiftUI](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui).

This section explores [Animation](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/animation) with [SwiftUI](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui) including [rotation3DEffect](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/view/rotation3deffect(_:axis:anchor:anchorz:perspective:)), [scaleEffect](<https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/view/scaleeffect(_:anchor:)-pmi7>), [easeOut](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/animation/easeout(duration:)), and more.

Exploring what happens with different animation values is fun!
