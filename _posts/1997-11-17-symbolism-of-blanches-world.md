In Tennessee Williams’s play, A Streetcar Named Desire, Blanche Dubois is a character who constantly strays from the truth. She deliberately lies to herself and refuses to acknowledge the truth, even if she sees it. Her illusions were more comforting, but they eventually lead to her destruction.

> I don’t want realism. I want magic! Yes, yes, magic! I try to give that to people. I misrepresent things to them. I don’t tell the truth, I tell what ought to be the truth. And if that’s sinful, then let me be damned for it!

Blanche lives in an illusionary world to escape her pain and the truth about her past. Williams cleverly uses many symbols to represent Blanche’s illusionary world. Blanche’s pain caused this retreat from the real world. She had been deeply in love with a boy called Allan Gray. Even though they were married, he was always somewhat nervous with her. One day, she discovers the truth about Allan when she sees him alone with another man. On the next day, Allan Gray shoots himself after leaving Blanche in the Moon Lake Casino. This completely destroys Blanche, and she feels guilty. To escape the pain, she constantly tries to purge herself and retreats into an imaginary world. Blanche takes many hot baths to purge herself of evil. Baths are a symbol of physical, emotional and spiritual cleansing.

Blanche’s “delicate beauty must avoid a strong light. There is something about her uncertain manner, as well as her white clothes, that suggests a moth.” This summarizes Blanche’s aversion to the light and why she embraces the darkness. The light symbolizes the truth, open and revealing. Blanche does not want to accept the truth, so she stays in the dark. Darkness also symbolizes Blanche because darkness is associated with illusion and lies. Her colored Chinese paper lantern also symbolizes Blanche’s magical world. The lantern shapes and alters light, just as Blanche shapes and alters the truth.

In the end, the illusions that comfort her eventually destroy her. When Blanche loses her illusions, she has nothing left to comfort her and she must accept the truth. When Stanley destroys Blanche’s illusion world, she loses her mind because she cannot accept the truth, and is sent away to an asylum.

The illusionary world that Blanche creates is both comforting and destructive. The illusions provide a way for Blanche to escape from the pain and the truth. In her illusionary world, she retreats from light and embraces the dark. The light is revealing, while the darkness is comforting. The destructive nature of the illusions is revealed when they are taken away. Then, she must accept the full truth, and she cannot handle the shock.
