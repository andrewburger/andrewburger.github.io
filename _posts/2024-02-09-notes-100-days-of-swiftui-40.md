Completed [Day 40](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui/40) in [100 Days of SwiftUI](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui).

This section explores further on the presentation of the data using [ScrollView](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/scrollview) and [NavigationLink](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/navigationlink) with [SwiftUI](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui) elements from yesterday. We decoded and reformatted dates from a local [JSON](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON) file into a more localized and human-friendly format using [dateDecodingStrategy](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/jsondecoder/2895216-datedecodingstrategy) and [DateFormatter](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/dateformatter), created our own custom color theme and SwiftUI modifiers by extending [ShapeStyle](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/shapestyle), and learned how to set [Dark Mode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacOS_Mojave#Dark_mode_and_accent_colors) for a view using [preferredColorScheme](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/view/preferredcolorscheme(_:)).

Really curious to see what the final view will look like for each item with a NavigationLink.
