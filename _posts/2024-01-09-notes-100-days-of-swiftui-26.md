Completed [Day 26](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui/26) in [100 Days of SwiftUI](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui).

This section continues our journey with [SwiftUI](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui) to build more common elements into apps. We covered how to enter data with controls like [Stepper](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/stepper) and [DatePicker](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/datepicker), get results using [Date](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/date) and [DateFormatter](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/dateformatter), and then [create a machine learning model](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/createml) for use with our app.

Like previous sessions, it was a quick tour of each component type with examples.
