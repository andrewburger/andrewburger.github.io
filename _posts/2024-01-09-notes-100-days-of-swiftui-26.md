Completed [Day 26](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui/26) in [100 Days of SwiftUI](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui).

This section continues our journey with [SwiftUI](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui) to build more common elements into apps. We covered how to to enter data with controls like [Stepper](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/stepper) and [DatePicker](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/datepicker). Then get back the results through [Date](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/date), [DateFormatter](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/dateformatter). Then wrapped up with a short introduction on how to [create a machine learning model](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/createml) for use with our app.

Like previous sessions, this was a quick tour of each component type with examples.
