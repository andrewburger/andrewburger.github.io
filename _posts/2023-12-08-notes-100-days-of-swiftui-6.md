Completed [Day 6](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui/6) in [100 Days of SwiftUI](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui).

Picked up a few interesting elements such as [labels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Label_(computer_science)) when handling certain statements and [tuples](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuple) in one of the review exercises.

I am pretty familiar with the flow of `for` and `while` patterns in code. Simple and powerful. Sometimes following the logic exhaustively can be tiring though.
