Completed [Day 31](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui/31) in [100 Days of SwiftUI](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui).

This section focused on enhancing the app the last two days without direct help or hints to confirm understanding. Easily completed the exercise.

Feeling really good and ready for the next challenge!
