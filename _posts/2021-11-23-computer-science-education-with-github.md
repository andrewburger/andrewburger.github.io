See how [GitHub helps student learn about Computer Science](https://githubuniverse.com/content-library/pushing-the-envelope-in-cs50/) with modern developer tools and workflows. This session (and other interesting content from GitHub) is part of the 2021 [GitHub Universe](https://githubuniverse.com) event.

In my opinion, the presentation provides good historical context about administrative challenges for colleges and universities when teaching Computer Science within the last decade.[^fn-college].

It is fascinating to see the overall landscape and the possibilities in this field change so dramatically in my lifetime. 

[^fn-college]: My own experiences with formal education go much further back.
