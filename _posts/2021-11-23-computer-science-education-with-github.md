I recently watched a presentation about how [GitHub helps students learn about Computer Science at Harvard University](https://githubuniverse.com/content-library/pushing-the-envelope-in-cs50/) with modern developer tools and workflows. This session (and other interesting content from GitHub) is part of the [GitHub Universe](https://githubuniverse.com) event in 2021.

The overall student experience for Computer Science has certainly evolved within the last decade.[^fn-college] While this session only highlights one possible approach, [GitHub Education](https://education.github.com/benefits) is still an amazing and flexible program for individual students and teachers.

It is fascinating to see the overall landscape and the possibilities in this field change so dramatically in my lifetime. There has never been a better time to learn more about programming or get real-world experience with free access to excellent developer tools.

[^fn-college]: My own experiences with formal education go much further back.
