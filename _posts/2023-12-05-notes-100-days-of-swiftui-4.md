Quickly finished [Day 4](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui/3) in [100 Days of SwiftUI](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui).

Simple and short look at [type inference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_inference) and type annotation. Also comes with a code challenge to gauge understanding, just like Day 2. Conceptually, no problem working through what to do but still needed to refer back to the syntax for the more complex data types.

Like anything else, I imagine it will become more natural with practice.
