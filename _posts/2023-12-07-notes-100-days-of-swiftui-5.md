All done with [Day 5](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui/5) in [100 Days of SwiftUI](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui).

Dived into logic elements such as [switch statements](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switch_statement) and the [ternary conditional operator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ternary_conditional_operator). The ternary conditional operator is interesting. I vaguely remember seeing this operator before in Haskell but it never really stuck with me at the time. Always felt weird but sometimes necessary for certain aspects in the functional programming paradigm.

After this explanation and review, I really feel like I get it now. Seems like this operator will be a common pattern in upcoming SwiftUI exercises.
