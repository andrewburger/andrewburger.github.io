Completed [Day 44](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui/44) in [100 Days of SwiftUI](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui).

This section explores [NavigationStack](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/navigationstack) further in [SwiftUI](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui). We build custom navigation using [navigationDestination](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/view/navigationdestination(for:destination:)), passing data through [@Binding](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/binding) property wrappers, and encoding NavigationPath information through [CodableRepresentation](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/navigationpath/codablerepresentation) into a [codable](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/navigationpath/codable) value inside the system  [documentsDirectory](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/url/3988456-documentsdirectory).

Feels like these components are used in many apps.
