Finished [Day 25](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui/25) in [100 Days of SwiftUI](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui).

This session marks the completion of first consolidation project with [SwiftUI](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui) based on previous projects. Reviewing working code patterns in earlier projects really helps me learn, practice, and remember.

Paul also suggests to not worry if you cannot complete challenges on the assigned day. I will keep that in mind for future projects.
