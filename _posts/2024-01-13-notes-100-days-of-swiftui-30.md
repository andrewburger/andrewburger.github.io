Completed [Day 30](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui/30) in [100 Days of SwiftUI](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui).

This section continues the journey with [SwiftUI](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui) through practice with existing element types in a new app project. Despite the fact that today was primarily a review of previous content, I learned about a new [withAnimation](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/withanimation(_:_:)) function and modifiers like [textInputAutocapitalization](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/view/textinputautocapitalization(_:)),  [onSubmit](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/view/onsubmit(of:_:)), and  [onAppear](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/view/onappear(perform:)).

[onSubmit](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/view/onsubmit(of:_:))  and  [onAppear](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/view/onappear(perform:)) seem really useful because you can attach function methods to a view. Simple and powerful.
