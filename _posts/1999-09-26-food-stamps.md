The Food Stamp Program (FSP) is a government-run program run by the U.S. Department of Agriculture. The Department of Agricultures (USDA) runs the FSP through the Food and Nutrition Service or FNS. The FNS gives needy families and children access to food in order to reduce hunger in the U.S.[^fn-mission]

The Food Stamp Program, initiated in 1961, issues monthly “food stamps”. These are coupons that can be used at retail food stores, or can give benefits through electronic benefit transfer (EBT). Using a plastic card, EBT can buy groceries directly from a food stamp account. FSP aid given to needy households and children is determined by household size, income, assets, and other factors. In 1997, an average of 22.9 million people by FSP. The Federal government pays for the benefits and shares with the States the cost of administrative expenses for the FSP. 25.1 billion is spent for 1998 alone. This would provide average benefits more than $71 per person per month.[^fn-program]

The rules of eligibility rely mostly upon resources, income, deductions, aliens, and work.[^fn-eligibility] Households may have $2,000. If at least one person is age 60 or older, the household can have $3,000. Certain resources are not counted. A home and lot, Supplemental Security Income, and Aid to Families with Dependent Children are not considered resources. Licensed vehicles that are: used at least 50 percent of the time to produce income, needed for long distance travel for work, used as the home, needed to transport a physically disabled household member, or needed to carry most of the household's fuel or water. If the value of the vehicles is over $4,650, it is counted in this manner: once per household, plus vehicles used for work, training, or education, or to seek work. For all other vehicles, it is counted as a resource if it is worth more than $4,650.[^fn-elig_resources]

For eligibility, the household must possess a certain income. Unless an elderly person or a person receiving certain types of disability payments, most households must meet both the gross and net income. Gross income means a household's total income, before any deductions, while net income means gross income minus deductions.[^fn-elig_income]

Households are not eligible for food stamps if: a household of one has a gross income more than $873.00 or a net income more than $671.00, if a household of two has a gross income more than $1,176.00 or a net income more than $905.00, if a household of three has a gross income more than $1,479.00 or a net income more than $1,138.00, if a household of four has a gross income more than $1,783.00 or a net income more than $1,371.00, if a household of five has a gross income more than $2,086.00 or a net income more than $1,605.00, if a household of six has a gross income more than $2,389.00 or a net income more than $1,838.00, if a household of seven has a gross income more than $2,693.00 or a net income more than $2,071.00, if a household of eight has a gross income more than $2,996.00 or a net income more than $2,305.00. For each additional person, add $304.00 to gross income and $234.00 to net income.[^fn-elig_income_chart]

To be eligible for food stamps, there are certain allowable deductions: 20 percent deduction from earned income, standard deduction of $134 for all households, dependent care deduction when needed for work, training, or education, or excess shelter costs which are more than half of the household's income after the other deductions.[^fn-elig_deductions]

U.S. citizens and many non-citizens may be eligible for the program. Here are some examples: Refugees, asylees, Cubans, Haitians, Amerasians, and persons whose deportation has been withheld may be eligible for 7 years after they enter the U.S. or are granted status; persons legally admitted for permanent residence may be eligible if they have 40 qualifying quarters of Social Security work coverage or they have a U.S. military connection; Native Americans who cross the Canadian or Mexican borders; and certain Hmong and Highland Laotians and their spouses and children. Able-bodied adults (between 16 and 60) must register for work, accept suitable employment, and take part in an employment and training program. In addition, able-bodied adults (between 18 and 50) who do not have any dependent children can get food stamps only for 3 months in a 36-month period if they do not work or participate in a workfare or employment and training program other than job search.[^fn-elig_aliens]

There are some general trends in the food stamp program. The number of food stamp cases declined 23 percent from January 1996 through February 1998 and the total disbursements declined by 25 percent throught the nation.[^fn-national_stamps] New York has a similar trend. The number of food stamp cases declined by 23 percent and total disbursements declined by 31 percent from January 1996 through February 1998.[^fn-ny_stamps]
