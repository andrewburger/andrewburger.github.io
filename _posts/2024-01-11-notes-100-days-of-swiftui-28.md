Completed [Day 28](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui/28) in [100 Days of SwiftUI](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui).

This session continues with more opportunities to practice. Was able to get through the exercises comfortably. Everything is feeling familiar and also I can draw upon previous work quickly to get a result.

Because Steve Jobs and Paul Hudson summarized my current state and desired progression best, I will simply quote them:

> All these things work independently of each other, by which I mean you can now use... stuff youâ€™ve learned [and] can be taken anywhere you want. As you progress with SwiftUI youâ€™ll add more and more of these jigsaw pieces, and in doing so youâ€™ll find you soon have hundreds of pieces that you can rearrange and build together to make remarkable things...

> Creativity is just connecting things. When you ask creative people how they did something, they feel a little guilty because they didn't really do it, they just saw something. It seemed obvious to them after a while. That's because they were able to connect experiences they've had and synthesize new things.

> ~ *Steve Jobs* 

> Thatâ€™s where I want you to reach with SwiftUI â€“ to know that when you have a new project idea you can reach for part of project 1, part of project 3, part of project 4, and beyond, and already be 75% towards your goal. Youâ€™ll get there â€“ just keep coming back each day!

I could not agree more.

Thank you Paul.
