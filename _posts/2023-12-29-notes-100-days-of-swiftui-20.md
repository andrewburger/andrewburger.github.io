Completed [Day 20](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui/17) in [100 Days of SwiftUI](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui).

This section continues our journey with [SwiftUI](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui) to build more common elements into apps.

We covered how to [build layouts with stack views](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/building-layouts-with-stack-views), add [Color](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/color) and [Gradient](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/gradient), build [Button](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/button) labels and actions, include an [Image](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/image), and show [Alert](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/view/alert(_:ispresented:presenting:actions:message:)-8584l) messages.

The content was a guided tour of each component type with examples.
