Finished [Day 13](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui/13) in [100 Days of SwiftUI](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui).

This section covers [protocols](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/documentation/the-swift-programming-language/protocols/) and [extensions](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/documentation/the-swift-programming-language/extensions/). In other programming languages, these elements are called [interfaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interface_(object-oriented_programming)) and [extensible programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extensible_programming) respectively. These constructs are very useful to build useful code patterns that are also easy to read, write, and maintain.

I really apprepriate these type of language features to keep code organized and fit your own needs.
