Finished [Day 13](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui/13) in [100 Days of SwiftUI](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui).

This section covers [protocols](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interface_(object-oriented_programming)) and [extensions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extensible_programming). These are quite useful to construct useful code patterns that are easier to both read and build.

These are welcome features when code base is very large, hard to conceptually understand, or if the syntax in a specific domain feels particularly obtuse.
