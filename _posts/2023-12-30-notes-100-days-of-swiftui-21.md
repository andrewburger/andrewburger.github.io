Finished [Day 21](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui/17) in [100 Days of SwiftUI](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui).

This section is more practice with [SwiftUI](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui) concepts learned previously. There is a lot more emphasis on the visual and creative aspect of app design, layout, and presentation.

One observation that continues to impress: it is very easy to use [Xcode Preview](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/SwiftUI/Previews-in-Xcode) to see immediate results while developing the app. The preview keeps up with every single code change, which makes SwiftUI an excellent fit for [quick prototyping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_prototyping). Up to this point, I have only infrequently needed to build and run to verify app behavior with the Simulator in development sessions.

I still have a lot of work to get familiar with the Swift language and related Apple frameworks. I am enjoying the learning process and its results so far.
