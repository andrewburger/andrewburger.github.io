Despite its uncertainty, we should organize our thoughts and actions about the future. Give ongoing thought about what you want the future to look like, what kind of future world you want to live in, and how you are going to get there.

The only thing you can control about the future is what you will do today and your ownership and accumulation of daily actions. Become an active participant.

What will you tackle today to make tomorrow better?
