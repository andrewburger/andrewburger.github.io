![This is a photo of me.](/assets/photo-about_me.jpg)

I work in Professional Services with the amazing folks from the [Apple Education Team](https://www.apple.com.education/). I have always been fascinated by technology, especially tools that help people learn and grow.

I got a Masterâ€™s degree in IT Management from [Regis University](http://regis.edu).  Before that, I was an undergraduate at [Binghamton University](http://binghamton.edu) in New York.  I still like to tinker and explore with code, hacker culture, and human-computer interaction in general.

Have questions or suggestions? Feel free to [check out my code on GitHub](https://github.com/andrewburger).
