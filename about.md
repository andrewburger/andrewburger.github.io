![This is a photo of me.](/assets/photo-about_me.jpg)

I am fascinated by technology, especially tools that help people learn and grow. I write code, follow hacker culture, and study human-computer interaction.

I provide direct consulting services to educational institutions, enterprise customers, and small businesses. Over a decade of experience managing custom on-premise infrastructure, endpoint management solutions, and app development services.

I received a Master of Science in Information Technology Management degree from [Regis University](https://www.regis.edu) and a Bachelor degree in Computer Science from [Binghamton University](https://www.binghamton.edu).  

Questions or suggestions? Take a look at [my code on GitHub](https://github.com/andrewburger).
