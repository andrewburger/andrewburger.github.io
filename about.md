![This is a photo of me.](/assets/photo-about_me.jpg)

I have always been fascinated by technology, especially tools that help people learn and grow. I like to explore with code, stay close to hacker culture, and study human-computer interaction.

I have worked with educational institutions and provided direct consulting services for small businesses for over 10 years.  I also have a lot of experience managing in-house infrastructure, staffing, and custom app development services for enterprise customers.

I earned a Master of Science in Information Technology Management degree from [Regis University](https://www.regis.edu) and a Bachelor degree in Computer Science from [Binghamton University](https://www.binghamton.edu).
