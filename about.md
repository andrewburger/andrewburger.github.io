![Here I am.](/assets/photo-about_me.jpg)

I am a Systems Engineer at [Crest Technologies](http://crest-tech.com) working with  
folks from the Apple Education Team. I have always been fascinated by technology
and especially tools for helping people learn and grow.

I got a Masterâ€™s degree in IT Management from [Regis
University](http://regis.edu).  Before that, I was an undergraduate at [Binghamton
University](http://binghamton.edu) in New York.  I still like to tinker
and explore with code, hacker culture, and human-computer interaction in general.

Have questions or suggestions? Feel free to [check out my code on GitHub](https://github.com/andrewburger).  You can follow me on twitter [@andrewaburger](https://twitter.com/andrewaburger).
