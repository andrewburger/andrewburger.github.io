![This is a photo of me.](/assets/photo-about_me.jpg)

I have always been fascinated by technology, especially tools that help people learn and grow. I like to explore code, understand hacker culture, and study human-computer interaction.

I work with educational institutions and provide direct consulting services to small businesses. Over a decade of experience managing custom on-premise infrastructure and app development services for enterprise customers.

I earned a Master of Science in Information Technology Management degree from [Regis University](https://www.regis.edu) and a Bachelor degree in Computer Science from [Binghamton University](https://www.binghamton.edu).  

Have questions or suggestions? Feel free to [check out my code on GitHub](https://github.com/andrewburger).
